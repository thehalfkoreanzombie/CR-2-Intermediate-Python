# My Second Code Review: Intermediate Python

## Alex Wallace

## Description
For this project, I had to use the module 'faker' to create a list of 20 random colors. I then created a function to remove any duplicates in that list of colors. After that, I created a function that turned my color list into a dictionary containing the colors as keys and their character length as values. I then wrote this dictionary into a json file and read it back into a python dictionary.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
In order to set this up, you will need to make a directory for your file and then switch over to that directory. Then, create a virtual environment for python 3 to work in. Change into your virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate. You will need to install the requirements.txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt). This will allow you to use jupyterlab and the modules faker and json.

## Known Bugs
There are no known bugs for this code. Overall, I had a good time writing this code and didn't run into too many obstacles.
